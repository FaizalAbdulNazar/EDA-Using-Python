OVERVIEW:

This project is about performing exploratory Data analysis on a weather dataset using Python. 
The dataset contains information about various weather parameters such as temperature, dew point temperature, relative humidity, wind speed etc.

DATASET:

The Weather Dataset used for this analysis contains the following columns:

Date/Time: Date and time of the recorded weather data.
Temp_C: Temperature in degrees Celsius.
Dew Point Temp_C: Dew point temperature in degrees Celsius.
Rel Hum_%: Relative humidity in percentage.
Wind Speed_km/h: Wind speed in kilometers per hour.
Weather_Condition: Description of weather condition at the recorded time.


Tools and Libraries Used:

Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

The EDA process includes the following steps:

Data Loading: Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, etc.

Data Exploration: Analyzing the distribution and summary statistics of each variable.

Usage:

To run the analysis:

Install Python and Jupyter Notebook.

Open Weather_Data_Analysis.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook.

Follow the instructions and run the code cells sequentially.

Conclusion:

The EDA on the Weather Dataset provides valuable insights into the weather patterns and trends. The analysis helps in understanding the relationships between different weather parameters, including the weather condition, and their variations over time.
